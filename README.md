# Data Analysis & Business Intelligence Internship Project | Adverk AI

This repository contains the projects completed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at Adverk AI from August to October 2024. This portfolio demonstrates skills in both programmatic data exploration with Python and interactive dashboard creation with Power BI.

## Project 1: Used Car Price - Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

This project involves a deep dive into a dataset of used car details to uncover trends and insights through data analysis and visualization.

### Objective

To perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors that influence the selling price of used cars.

### Key Activities

-   **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loaded the `CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
-   **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Inspected the data for missing values and inconsistencies to prepare it for analysis.
-   **Statistical Summary:** Generated descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of numerical data like price, year, and kilometers driven.
-   **Data Visualization:** Created scatter plots and bar charts using Matplotlib to visualize the relationships between variables (e.g., Selling Price vs. Year, Selling Price vs. Kilometers Driven).

### Technologies Used

-   **Language:** Python
-   **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib
-   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Project 2: Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This project focuses on creating a dynamic and interactive business intelligence dashboard to monitor key supply chain metrics.

### Objective

To build a user-friendly dashboard that provides a clear overview of supply chain performance, including revenue, profit, and sales volume, with the ability to filter by various dimensions.

### Key Features & Visualizations

-   **KPI Monitoring:** Displays high-level metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Total Products Sold.
-   **Profit Over Time:** An area chart tracks the sum of total profit over the years, highlighting trends and seasonality.
-   **Revenue by Channel & City:** Interactive pie and bar charts break down revenue sources, allowing for easy identification of top-performing channels and cities.
-   **Interactive Filtering:** Users can dynamically filter the entire dashboard by Channel, Year, and Warehouse Code to drill down into specific insights.

### Technologies Used

-   **Business Intelligence Tool:** Microsoft Power BI

## How to View This Project

-   **Python EDA:** The Jupyter Notebook (`MajorProject.ipynb`) can be viewed directly in this repository.
-   **Power BI Dashboard:** A PDF export of the dashboard (`power bi adverk project.pdf`) is included for viewing the final report. The raw Power BI file (`power bi.pbix`) is also available.
